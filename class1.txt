Programming language
====================
Diagram: class1.1

A language which is used to communicate between user and computer is called programming language.

Programming language acts like a mediator or interface between user and computer.

Programming language divided into two types.

1) Low Level Language 

2) High Level Language 


1) Low Level Language 
--------------------
A language which is understand by a computer easily is called low level language.

A language which is computer dependent is called low level language.

ex:
	Machine language 
	Assembly language 


Machine language
------------------
It is a fundamental language of a computer which is combination of 0's and 1's.

It is also known as binary language.

A computer understands many languages but to understand machine language it does not required any translator.

Advantages:

> A program writtens in machine language consumes less memory.

> It does not required any translator.

> It is more efficient when compare to other languages.

Disadvantages:

> It is a burdun on a programmer to remember dozen's of binary code.

> If anywhere error raised in our program then locating and handling that error becomes
  difficult.

> Modifications can't be done easily.


Assembly language
-------------------
The second generation language came into an existence is called assembly language.

Assembly language is a replacement of symbols and letters for our mathematical programming code.

Assembly language is also known symbolic language.

Assembly language can't understand by a computer directly. We required translator.

We have three translators.

i) Assembler 

ii) Compiler 

iii) Interpreter 

i) Assembler 
------------
It is one of the translator which is used to convert assemblic code to machine code.

Merits:

> If anywhere error raised in our program then locating and handling that error becomes
  easy.

> Modifications can be done easily.

Demerits:

> It is a mind trick to remember all symbolic code.

> It requires translator.

> It is less efficient when compare to machine language.


Q) What is Debugging?

Bug is also known as Error.
The process of eliminating the bugs from the application is called debugging.


2) High level language
-----------------------
A language which is understand by a user easily is called high level language.

In general, A language which is user dependent is called high level language.

ex:
	C++, Java, .Net, Python and etc.

High level language can't understand by a computer directly. We required translators.

compiler 
--------
	It is used to compile and execute our program at a time.

interpreter 
-----------
	It is used to execute our program line by line procedure.

Advantages:

> It is easy to learn and easy to use because it is similar to english language.

> Debugging can be done easily.

> Modifications can be done easily.

Disadvantages:

> A program writtens in high level language consumes huge amount of memory.

> It requires translators.

> It is not efficient when compare to machine language.
